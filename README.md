# A-Simple-Python-Calculator
a literal calculator. (And a colorized one!)

And no, it is not a virus, it is a calculator i made because im bored as fuck. you can scan it with an antivirus, or with https://www.virustotal.com/
if it does detect like its a virus, well its false and i dont know why, if you dont trust it then dont open it i guess.

!WARNING! for the calculator to work, you need to install Python 3.6.0 or higher: https://www.python.org/downloads/
