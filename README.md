# A-Simple-Python-Calculator
a literal calculator. (And a colorized one!)

And no, it is not a virus, it is a calculator i made because im bored as fuck. you can scan it with an antivirus, or with https://www.virustotal.com/
if it does detect like its a virus, well its false and i dont know why, if you dont trust it then dont open it i guess.

!WARNING! for the calculator to work, you need to install Python 3.6.0 or higher: https://www.python.org/downloads/


> Update v1.1!
>
>Changes:
>
>-Repeat Calculations: The calculator now asks if you want to calculate again. This allows for multiple calculations without having to restart the program.
>
>-Support for Float Numbers: My calculators now accept float numbers! Whether it's a simple number like 102.5 or a crazy one like 1452.51653623632, my calculators can handle it all.
>
>-Colorized Calculator: We've added a new calculator that uses colors instead of plain white text.
>
>!WARNING! Colors are not supported on a normal terminal. They only work on certain terminals. I highly recommend 'Windows Terminal' from the Microsoft Store App. If you prefer not to download it, the normal calculator is still available. 
>It may be plain and less colorful, but it works perfectly!
