# A-Simple-Python-Calculator
a literal calculator. (And a colorized one!)

And no, it is not a virus, it is a calculator i made because im bored as fuck. you can scan it with an antivirus, or with https://www.virustotal.com/
if it does detect like its a virus, well its false and i dont know why, if you dont trust it then dont open it i guess.

!WARNING! for the calculator to work, you need to install Python 3.6.0 or higher: https://www.python.org/downloads/


> Update v1.1!

Changes:

-Repeat Calculations: The calculator now asks if you want to calculate again. This allows for multiple calculations without having to restart the program.

-Support for Float Numbers: My calculators now accept float numbers! Whether it's a simple number like 102.5 or a crazy one like 1452.51653623632, my calculators can handle it all.

-Colorized Calculator: We've added a new calculator that uses colors instead of plain white text.

!WARNING! Colors are not supported on a normal terminal. They only work on certain terminals. I highly recommend 'Windows Terminal' from the Microsoft Store App. If you prefer not to download it, the normal calculator is still available. 
It may be plain and less colorful, but it works perfectly!
